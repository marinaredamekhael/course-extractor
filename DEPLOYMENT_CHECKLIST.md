## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- **Problem**: Heroku build fails

### App Crashes
- **Problem**: App crashes on Heroku
- **Solution**: Check logs with `heroku logs --tail`

### Static Files Not Loading
- **Problem**: CSS/JS files not loading
- **Solution**: Verify static folder structure and Flask configuration

### Database Issues
